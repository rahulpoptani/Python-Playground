There are many examples of blocking function calls in concurrent programming.

Common examples include:

    Waiting for a lock, e.g. calling acquire() on a threading.Lock.
    Waiting to be notified, e.g. calling wait() on a threading.Condition.
    Waiting for a thread to terminate, e.g. calling join() on a threading.Thread.
    Waiting for a semaphore, e.g. calling acquire() on a threading.Semaphore.
    Waiting for an event, e.g. calling wait() on a threading.Event.
    Waiting for a barrier, e.g. calling wait() on a threading.Barrier
