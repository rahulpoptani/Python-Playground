# An orphan process is created when the parent of a child process is terminated.

# Some ways that a parent process may be terminated leaving the child process orphaned include:
    # Parent process finishes.
    # Parent raises an uncaught error or exception.
    # Parent process calls sys.exit() or os._exit().
    # The Process.terminate() or Process.kill() methods are called on the parent.
    # A process calls os.kill() with the parentâ€™s PID.
    # Process is killed externally, e.g. via the kill command.

# If a process is orphaned, it can be difficult to programmatically get a handle on it.
# In turn, it can be challenging to query the status of orphaned processes or to terminate them.

# Some solutions could be:
    # Other processes keep a reference to processes that could be orphaned, e.g. Process instances.
    # Store process identifiers (PIDs) for child processes that could be orphaned, e.g. in a file.
    # Child processes can check if they are orphaned and take action accordingly.
