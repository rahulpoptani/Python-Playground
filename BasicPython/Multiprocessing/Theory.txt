Why not aloways use Process instead of Thread. What are the limitations?

1. We may have thousands of threads, but perhaps only tens of processes.
2. Threads are small and fast, whereas processes are large and slow to create and start.
3. Threads can share data quickly and directly, whereas processes must pickle and transmit data to each other.
